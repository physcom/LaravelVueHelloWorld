## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:



## Running this app

``` sh

npm install
npm run dev
php artisan serve

```

## From Scratch
``` sh

npm init
npm install
npm install vue-router
npm run dev

```

Do not forget to change app.js in resources/js and webpack.mix.js to include asset files from resources. Create your Controller to use Vue and change route. 

## License

The Laravel framework is open-source software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
